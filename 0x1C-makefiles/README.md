# Makefiles
- This is a file that containes a set of rules and precendents on how programs are to be executed.

A simple makefile consists of "rules" with the following shape:

```sh

``` target ... : dependencies ...
        command
        ...
        ...
```
- A *target* is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are executable or object files. A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as `clean'.

- A *dependency* is a file that is used as input to create the target. A target often depends on several files.

- A *command* is an action that make carries out. A rule may have more than one command, each on its own line. 

***Please note: you need to put a tab character at the beginning of every command line!**
